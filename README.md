# chemistry
:warning: **DISCLAIMER:** I hate chemistry. I wrote this to make some of the homework less tedious. This code is good enough for my chem 101 course, but it will generate incorrect results in certain situations, and I don't care enough to fix some of these issues. I wouldn't recommend actually using this code. :warning:
